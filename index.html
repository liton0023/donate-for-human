              By reviewing a handful of medical, bioethical, anthropological,
              sociological, and Islamic religious literature, the aim of the
              study is to undertake an ethical analysis solely on issues
              relating to priority access for family members to organs. More
              specifically, this paper is an ethical study of how the Islamic
              family system affects the provisions of the Act by motivating
              <!-- individuals to legally donate organs to family members for
              transplantation and to prioritize the receipt of their organs by
              family relatives after their death. -->
